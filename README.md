# iBeacon  Location Based App

## About
This is an ios app that works as a data collection sensor leveraging beacon technology. I built this for Halliburton under the guidance of Amir Bar as a side project. Specifically, this app runs on the iOS devices attached to equipments on Halliburton's working field. It aims to detect and report entrance and exits of employees wearing beacon to provide customized training/safety guidelines. It is also wired up with Halliburton's backend  database using Experience API (xAPI).

## Getting Started
